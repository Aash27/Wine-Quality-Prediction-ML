# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction (ML)

This repository contains a **machine learning project** for predicting wine quality using the **Wine Quality dataset** from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality).  
The project explores various **machine learning algorithms and techniques** to estimate wine quality based on chemical properties.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ **Data Preprocessing**: cleaning, feature scaling, and feature engineering  
- ✅ **Algorithms Implemented**: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
- ✅ **Model Evaluation**: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score  
- ✅ **Visualizations**: data distributions, feature importance, and model performance  
- ✅ **Modular Code Structure**: organized for easy experimentation and extension  
- ✅ **Comprehensive Jupyter Notebooks**: step-by-step explanations of methodology
