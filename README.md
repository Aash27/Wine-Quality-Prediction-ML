# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction (ML)

This repository contains a **machine learning project** for predicting wine quality using the **Wine Quality dataset** from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality).  
The project explores various **machine learning algorithms and techniques** to estimate wine quality based on chemical properties.
